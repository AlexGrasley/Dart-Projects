Wastegram

This app is for tracking and minimizing food waste in a retail environment. A restaurant that has a lot of ready made food at the end of the day that cannot be kept would use this app to track exactly how much they are wasting and be able get a better handle on the problem. The apps goal is to help illuminate this problem and find solutions, such as donating this "wasted" food instead of throwing it out. 

Any steps a company can do to minimize food waste is great, and Wastegram is here to help.
